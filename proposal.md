# Project Proposal

{(whoami|} {|whoami)}

Name: Alican Kaplan
City email: Alican.Kaplan@city.ac.uk

{(task|}

You should complete this datavis project proposal by **Sunday 3rd November, 5pm UK time** ensuring you have committed and pushed it to GitHub. Successful submissions by that time will be awarded up to **5 marks** towards your coursework assessment total.

{(questions|}

- How does the annual healthcare expenditure correlate with GP patient satisfaction in the UK?
- What is the relationship between healthcare spending across the UK regions? (Spatial)
- How has the variation in healthcare spending changed across UK regions from 2019 to 2022? (Temporal)

_A brief sentence or two with links to data sources._

I have found a variety of different data sources which will accompany me on this project.

I will use data from The Census website: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthcaresystem/datasets/healthaccountsreferencetables

This link will be for UK Health accounts and expenditure, which is the basis of my project. This data set spans to numerous years which will allow me to compare and contrast data in order to produce my data visualization.

https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/country-and-regional-analysis-2023 - Regional Expenditure for healthcare

This link provides spreadsheets (third document) which shows the difference in UK health expenditure and £ per head expenditure as well. This dataset will be key for my research questions 2 and 3. The sheet A.11 and A.15 is the piece of data I will focus on. This explores yearly data ranging from 2018 onwards.

https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthcaresystem/articles/measuringnhsexperienceandsatisfactionacrosstheuk/2024-05-30#data-sources-and-quality 

This link provides me on information which can take me to pages which represent patient satisfaction, which also leads me to this website: 

https://gp-patient.co.uk/practices-search

This website leads me to datasets which represent all the GPs within the NHS and lists their patient satisfaction data. 

This link provides me with access to the data sets: 
https://gp-patient.co.uk/surveysandreports2021 

Additional websites which contain numerous data sources which I may use:

https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/data-collection-and-curation and https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/ This is heavily focused on performance.

{(justification|}

_A couple of sentences on why you need datavis to answer your research questions._

My justification for using data visualization to help answer my research questions, stems from being able to illustrate engagement with the skills I have learnt during this module to portray data to identify patterns. This may lead to perhaps selling a story about how healthcare expenditure can affect our lives. Subsequently, I want to be able to use data visualization and its tools to illustrate complex data sets into a simple, aesthetically pleasing and understandable piece of visualization so that anyone can understand it without any prior knowledge about a topic which can enhance my audience reach.

In addition to this, I believe that from my visualization, I will be able to monitor trends and spot anomalies. This could be used to help identify key areas of success and failures and show which sectors may need more support, so that we can further amplify the healthcare within the UK. Furthermore, these visualizations can educate the public which can improve participation in healtcare discussions. I will try to implement interactive visualizations which can further show emphasis towards specific regions, by highlighting the corresponding funding amount and patient satisfaction within their region.

Ultimately, my desire to make such visualization stems from one of the lectures including a visualization which illustrated the Neighbourhoods by income deprivation (Session 3). I want to be able to make a similar visualization to this which can portray my visualization of healthcare and how different areas are affected by the amount of funding contributed towards them, showing disparities and driving awareness for improvements.
